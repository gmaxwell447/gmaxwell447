### Hi, Gary Maxwell here...

I'm a legacy embedded firmware developer who has been branching into additional full stack roles as my company pares back personnel.

So, after several lifetimes of assembly code, C, and Makefiles, I've been working with Virtualbox/VMware, Jenkins, JavaScript, Node.js, and anything else my employer requires.

Although I prefer Windows as my primary development platform, I typically have several SSH sessions to various Linux boxes used to build anything from ARM firmware to FreeSwitch applications.

Here on GitHub, I'm really just trolling around for great ideas, projects, and people. Thanks for reading this far!

(Currently not looking for other opportunities.)
